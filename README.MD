## Deep Hallucination Classification
 - Classify images hallucinated by deep generative models:


This is a deep image hallucination classification challenge in which competitors train deep classification models on a data set containing images generated by deep generative models. Competitors are scored based on the classification accuracy on a given test set. For each test image, the participants have to predict its class label.




### Used Machine Learning Classifiers:
 - Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC)
 - Suport Vector Machine(SVM) Classifier




### Implementation details:
 - The machine learning models were implemented in Python 3 using the scikit-learn library
